            <h1>My History of Games</h1>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For as long as I can remember, I have thoroughly enjoyed video games. What started on the Nintendo SP, 
            playing Pokemon Fire Red after school, evolved into a passion for completion, collection, and competition that has transcended console
            and genre. On the App Store, I managed a daily global leaderboard score on DoodleJump, thus cementing my gamertag as super_doodle on the Playstation.
            From there, I continued to enjoy the pokemon franchise, FPS games such as Call of Duty, and more adventure style games like Skyrim or The Last of Us. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flash forward to the summer of 2016 and the release of two major titles: Pokemon Go and Overwatch. This is when I 
            would consider gaming as a fun pasttime moved toward becoming a serious hobby. I had just graduated High School and was looking for 
            opportune ways to spend times with my friends before we went our separate ways. During the day, we would explore nearby parks and malls playing pokemon, and 
            in the evening, would log on to battle.net to play the new FPS that was nothing like we had ever seen or played before. It was amazing.       
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are in the current year and my involvement with these games still perstists, yet in a new form. With Overwatch, I now find it a 
            familiar game to play with friends. Every now and then, I'll go through a competitive phase where I attempt to claim a spot on the global leaderboards.
            This year, I achieved my highest ranking of all time: #71 in the North Americas region.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Pokemon GO, I play nearly every day, even if it is just to login for a minute. I use it to meet people
            in the surrounding area, joing local discord or facebook groups to coordinate meetups. I partake in the competitive battling format known as GO Battle League, 
            with my highest rating being #247 in the world in October 2021. Lastly, and perhaps what I am most prouf of is the collection I have built over the last seven
            years of playing the game. Namely, my lucky pokedex as well as some special pokemon that I have gotten lucky enough to encounter, some even having slim odds such as 1 in 1.8 million.
